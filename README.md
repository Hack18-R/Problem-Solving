# Problem Solving Repository 💻

Welcome to my **Problem Solving Repo**!
Here, I practice a variety of programming problems to improve my skills in **Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, and more**.

## Contents 🗂️

This repository is organized into the following categories:

### 1. Pattern Problems 📐

* Problems focused on printing patterns using loops.
* Example: Pyramid patterns, triangle patterns, number patterns.

### 2. Number Problems 🔢

* Problems related to numbers, math, and logic.
* Example: Prime numbers, factorials, Fibonacci series.

### 3. Arrays Problems 📊

* Problems based on arrays and their operations.
* Example: Sorting, searching, finding max/min, rotations.

### 4. String Problems ✍️

* Problems focused on string manipulation.
* Example: Reversing strings, palindrome check, substring search.

### 5. DSA Problems 📚

* Problems involving Data Structures & Algorithms.
* Example: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming.

### 6. OOPs Problems 🏗️

* Object-Oriented Programming challenges.
* Example: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

### 7. Platform Problems 🌐

* Problems from coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.

If you want, I can **write a fully formatted README file** with **folders linked, emojis, and badges** that looks professional for GitHub. It’ll be ready to copy-paste.

Do you want me to do that?
