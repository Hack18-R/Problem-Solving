# Problem Solving & DSA

This repository contains my structured practice of **problem solving and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It is aimed at building strong **logical thinking**, preparing for **technical interviews**, and improving coding skills for **real-world projects**.

---

## Objectives
- Strengthen logic and problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation in DSA
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Apply problem-solving concepts in projects and other technologies

---

## Topics Covered

### Basics
- Input / Output
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Pattern problems (stars, numbers, alphabets)
- Number & math logic (prime, factorial, palindrome, GCD/LCM, Fibonacci)
- Basic bit manipulation

### Core DSA
- Arrays (1D, 2D, Matrix)
- Strings
- Hashing / Frequency counting
- Two Pointers

### Recursion & Backtracking
- Recursion fundamentals
- Backtracking (subsets, permutations)

### Data Structures
- Stack
- Queue / Deque
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
